With this script you connect a kazoo webhook to it and then will get connected to couchdb and parse variables with postgresql queries to be executed on fusionpbx's environment.

Note that you should configure fusionpbx with provisioner settings enabled and configure opentelecom's provisioner for visualize the phones JSON on SmartPBX

I am going  to upload a custom script that exec some regex and it results on a list of curl commands to be  executed when configuring opentelecom's /api/phones/ section.
